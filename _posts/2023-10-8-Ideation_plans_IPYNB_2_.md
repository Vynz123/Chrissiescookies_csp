## Home Screen
The main hero section of our page that utilizes design elements to tell the viewer what our website does and convince them to continue scrolling the other pages.

- The Hero section will pull in users using Tailwind CSS styling and 3D models and animations.
- Then the user will see a quick background that allows them to easily go to the catalog screen.
- If they continue to scroll they will see our social media and contact screens.
   
## Catalog Screen
The catalog screen is where the full catalog of products will be listed. We will use a mix of frontend and backend to make a good-looking, and efficient catalog that is easy to use.
- Main Features:
  - Checkout button to shift to the checkout bag and select products to buy.
    
## Checkout and Order Screen
The checkout screen will use Stripe for payment integration and utilize Sanity for data state management.
- The screen will use Sanity to be able to easily add products through the clicks of a few buttons.
- It will use a state manager to determine when the user clicks a product to add to the cart.
- The screen will then use Stripe to finish the transaction and send the confirmation to the main server indicating for the product to be shipped out. -->
